				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This infinite world is made up of a bunch of stars that flash on and off randomly. I found it enjoyable to look at, and not much deeper than that.
					Exploring around you will see new stars show up and disappear.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Carter: The picture is painted over by randomly generated circles. The way that the circles are generated is with the ellipse function and a mutation algorithm.
					The algorithm takes in hyperparams that slightly change how the circles behave when they are generated. The circles were able to be generated using the ellipse function
					because when you feed the function the same number for its diameter, it creates a circle.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Carter: This was a fun process overall, the collaboration was great. This experiment lended itself very well to dividing and conquering. I think that 
					I was tasked with the easiest of the three shapes. The tricky part was figuring out how to actually get circles on the screen because there is not a built-in
					circle function. I was able to solve this fairly quickly using the ellipse function. Acutally fiddling with the hyperparams ended up being pretty fun. The 
					process on refining the algorithm was satisfying and my experience with this project was great.
