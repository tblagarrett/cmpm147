				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment is to make a collection of shapes resemble a given image. This is done by placing them randomly and assessing how successful it 
					was, iterating on the most successful versions and making it more precist by tuning down the mutation rate. As time goes by, a shape of the original image
					should become visible, though not perfect as this is an impression.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Carter: The picture is painted over by randomly generated circles. The way that the circles are generated is with the ellipse function and a mutation algorithm.
					The algorithm takes in hyperparams that slightly change how the circles behave when they are generated. The circles were able to be generated using the ellipse function
					because when you feed the function the same number for its diameter, it creates a circle.

					Garrett: Each triangle is made from a preset template, and are adjusted solely through position and rotation. The triangle size will scale with the size
					of the image, so that it can work with any size image. In total, there are 500 triangles throughout the image. As time progresses and the mutation rate
					narrows it becomes more and more precise, lending to long generation times and a slow process.

					James: I chose two manga pannels because they are black and white and they would have suited the line structure.
					Unforutnately, I only managed to create horizontal lines, so it didn't turn out how I hoped. I randomly generated 1500 rectangles with random positioning and length, but constrained the 
					height to less than 7 pixels. It continually places the lines, on the canvas and mutates them trying to match the shapes of the manga pannels. It really doesn't come out nicely, since the lines
					are all horizontal and the pannels include lines in all directions.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Carter: This was a fun process overall, the collaboration was great. This experiment lended itself very well to dividing and conquering. I think that 
					I was tasked with the easiest of the three shapes. The tricky part was figuring out how to actually get circles on the screen because there is not a built-in
					circle function. I was able to solve this fairly quickly using the ellipse function. Acutally fiddling with the hyperparams ended up being pretty fun. The 
					process on refining the algorithm was satisfying and my experience with this project was great.

					Garrett: Like Carter said, this project really lended itself to collaboration. I enjoyed being able to split up the load and see the results of my
					friends' works. A couple of things I would add, should time and motivation allot would be making the mutation change automatic, by slowly tuning it down
					based on the progress of the generation. I would also like to implement color! All in all, I think this project went well and I enjoyed working with others.

					James: I'll be the third to say that this project was super nice to work on in a group! We all worked on our own sections and collaborated while working on it. It was inspiring to see what
					the others could make and trying to create something equally interesting. It was reassuring to hear that the others also had trouble with the circle function. I probably would have been 
					banging my head against a wall for hours instead of just trying other functions. I'm glad I could work with my friends and create some interesting images. I just wish I could have figured out the line function!
