				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Overworld:</p>
				<p>The second half was all about using noise to generate a nice overworld location.
					Because I had already worked on the autotiling in the other half, I was able to
					transfer it over and I had more time to really embellish the scene. The end result
					is a nice varied landscape that changes over time. To me, it is addicting to look at.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Overworld:</p>
				<p>Using the same techniques to place tiles as the previous half, this scene makes a completely
					different vibe. I used and customized perlin noise to make the 3 different effects: clouds,
					water, and general terrain generation. The water changes over time using the 3rd dimension,
					while the clouds simply scroll in a random direction
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Almost this entire half was without any ChatGPT, which is a bit of a pride point for me after
					the first half. It is also the type of generation I am most interested in, world generation is
					something I seem to find infinitely interesting.
