				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Create an infinite world depicting terrain. This world contains flatlands, water, and mountains. The mountains and flatlands have color blending,
					while the water has a wave moving over time using a sin.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>All of the physical adjustment is done using a noise map based on the seed, the squares are translated up based on the value and split into categories.
					The water does not have this displacement, and instead uses a sin function using time to determine its position
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a great first of 3 experiments for this week. I got a good understanding of how the grid works, how functions can be applied to it. I also
					got some good ideas for the next experiments!
