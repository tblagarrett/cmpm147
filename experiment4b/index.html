				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This infinite world simply plays with a wave effect spreading out from where the player clicks their mouse. These waves will combine when overlapping
					and dissipate over time. It plays with the assignment a bit, since without clicking it looks like nothing changed, but after clicking you see the movement
					and color change. It was so much fun for me to play with that I made a second version of it without the color, so that it lags less.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>When a tile is clicked, a wave is generated at that position, causing nearby tiles to be displaced. The wave effect gradually diminishes over time 
					and distance. Each tile's movement is calculated based on its distance from the wave origin and the time since the wave was generated. The height of 
					each tile is determined by adding all active waves in that spot. The color blends between 2 random colors, one for up and one for down, changing
					the color based on the height.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I LOVED this one. the wave effect is really something that i enjoy, especially in isometric view. It took a lot of ChatGPT, but I really felt like my
					vision for the project got through to the end--which is not something not always easy to do.
