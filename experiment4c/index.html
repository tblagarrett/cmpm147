				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This infinite world is made up of a bunch of stars that flash on and off randomly. I found it enjoyable to look at, and not much deeper than that.
					Exploring around you will see new stars show up and disappear.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This is done by manipulating the clicks function provided in the base. giving each drawn square a starting number of clicks, we add to it after a random
					amount of time. This creates an effect where the starts flicker on and off. I kept the effect slow, having it update every second instead of every frame.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I would call this one a sequence of failures stumbling to something that looks alright. It has a big problem with optimization, being a little boring, and
					failure to execute on my ideas. But honestly, I think that's okay since I liked the other two so much. I spent a whole day doing the others, and couldn't 
					come up with a good idea for this one that I was interested in. Such is life!
