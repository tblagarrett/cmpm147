				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Create a unique generator on glitch.com and move the working generator to my portfolio page. Work to understand how generators can work
					and the different languages involved in web development.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>A grammar is defined with simple replacement tokens. A replacer() function picks a random replacement for any token that appears in the text.
					My personal contribution was solely by changing the different words that can be shuffled in, to make it a self-help book title generator
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I did not feel particularly motivated to work on this project, and so I simply did what was necessary to get it done. Perhaps I may return to
					work on it further, but for now this is where it will leave off.
