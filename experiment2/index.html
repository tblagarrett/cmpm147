					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The goal of this experiment was to first learn more about how p5.js works, and to recreate
						this image by Olivia Sullivan.

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: All colors come from a color picker using the source image, including borders.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The tree in the top right, all 3 boxes, and the sun come from primitive shapes.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The background mountains, "bushes" and "grass" all are made using polygons and vertex calls.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains, bushes, grass, lines on the tree, and position of the Sun</li>
                        <li>Life: The leaves on the tree move up and down over time, swaying. The sun goes around in a circle, changing the color of the square behind it</li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm honestly a little conflicted as to how this assignment went. I think that the end result is wonderful,
					but I do not feel strong about the approach to get there. This is the most I have used ChatGPT for an
					assignment, and it provided invaluable assistance. I got more done in less time than I could have done by
					my self; however, it didn't feel like <em>I</em> did it. Don't get me wrong, I learned a bunch, made a lot
					of changes to the code, wrote the prompts to the AI, and made sure my vision for the project was executed.
					But I felt somewhat abstracted away from the process. I felt less involved up close and that I learned less
					than I would have, had I done this without AI.
