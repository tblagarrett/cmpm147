				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Dungeon:</p>
				<p>For this first part, the goal was to understand how tilemaps work, mostly
					through hardcoding in small details. A lot of time was spent here figuring out how the 
					autotiling works. I got a lot of bug fixing experience in, and it built up
					a good foundation for the second part
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Dungeon:</p>
				<p>This is made possible by placing random rectangles and making sure they do not collide.
					The rectangles are connected by the center if possible, and a chest is placed in a random
					one of the "rooms." All of it is done without noise, which plans to be changed in the next half
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
